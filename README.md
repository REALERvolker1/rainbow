# rainbow

A script written in Rust so I can have all the colors of the rainbow

It takes no arguments, and prints color codes like so:
```
#0006FF
#0005FF
#0004FF
#0003FF
#0002FF
#0001FF
#0000FF
#0100FF
#0200FF
#0300FF
#0400FF
#0500FF
#0600FF
#0700FF
```

Q: *Why did you write this in rust?*

A: Because I dislike latency

Q: *Why does this exist?*

A: Because I like colors

Q: *Will you actively maintain this?*

A: Probably not lmao
